This repository includes functions for doing statistics in J.  Some
functions (Student's t distribution) require the R environment to be
set up.

All public functions hold documentation in the first two lines of their
bodies.  The documentation is of the following format:

```
verb_name =: 4 : 0
    NB. Description of function
    NB. x: What the x should look like
    NB. y: What the y should look like
)
```

Feel free to make suggestions and submit pull requests.
